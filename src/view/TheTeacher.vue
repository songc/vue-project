          <h4>Research Interests</h4>
          <p>Embedded system and applications: The main focus is 
            on the development of reliable real time embedded system. 
            Also, my research interest includes wireless sensor networks and applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Signal processing: We have pioneered the use of signal processing methods 
            for plant electrical signal and have for the first time investigated 
            the use of a monitoring system to measure plant electrical signal non-invasively 
            in greenhouse. All researches were supported by National Natural Science Foundation 
            of China (Grant No. 60571027) and National High Technology Research and Development 
            Program of China (Grant No.2008AA10Z201).
          </p>
          <p>
            Non-invasive Detection and instruments: One direction is development and application 
            of novel optical methods and instruments for determining the quality of fresh meat. 
            Another direction in this research area is biomedical photonics and applications.
